## For develop

At first, you need to install Node.js with Node.js version manager(For example, [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv))

```
npm i
```

You have to modify only `src` directory's files

If you finish changing files, please run `npm run build` and you can confirm output files at `dist`. Then, you can install extension on your Google Chrome
